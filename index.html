						<p>Home Spice is a cooking show that inspires people to share their recipes and a part of themselves. My inspiration for my capstone is how cooking serves as an act of love and a bridge between people. I want to make a home cooking show that highlights this theme: there is heart behind the recipe. </p>

						<p>I am making the show with my partner and local comedian, Ali Sultan. He is the host and will venture into different guest’s kitchens to cook their recipe and share a meal and conversation together. Home Spice is a cooking show that showcases beloved recipes and cooking techniques but also explores how food brings people together. </p>

						<p>I think cooking can be messy, informal and personable. The goal is to create a cooking show that is inclusive and friendly to all levels of cooking. You don’t have to be a top chef to make someone feel special through cooking for them. </p>

				<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
				<div class="explanation">
					<p>Many cooking shows only focus on the execution of the dish. They focus on cooking techniques and how to prefect a recipe. The way cooking is portrayed across media tend to hide the mess, the imperfections and the process around making a meal. The focus on creating a picture perfect dish can intimidate new cooks to the kitchen.</p>
					<p>The emphasis on unattainable perfectionism can take some of the warmth and fun out of cooking. The real power of cooking, especially home cooking, is its ability to bring people together. The design challenge is to create cooking material that is warm, has depth and is non-intimidating. My aim is for Home Spice to tell more human-centric stories around cooking.</p>
