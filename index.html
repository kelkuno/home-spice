						<p>Home Spice is a cooking show that inspires people to share their recipes and a part of themselves. My inspiration for my capstone is how cooking serves as an act of love and a bridge between people. I want to make a home cooking show that highlights this theme: there is heart behind the recipe. </p>

						<p>I am making the show with my partner and local comedian, Ali Sultan. He is the host and will venture into different guest’s kitchens to cook their recipe and share a meal and conversation together. Home Spice is a cooking show that showcases beloved recipes and cooking techniques but also explores how food brings people together. </p>

						<p>I think cooking can be messy, informal and personable. The goal is to create a cooking show that is inclusive and friendly to all levels of cooking. You don’t have to be a top chef to make someone feel special through cooking for them. </p>
