					<p>Many cooking shows only focus on the execution of the dish. They focus on cooking techniques and how to prefect a recipe. The way cooking is portrayed across media like tv shows, cookbooks, social media, etc., tend to hide the mess, the imperfections and the process around making a meal. The focus on creating a picture perfect dish takes some of the warmth out of cooking.</p>  
	
					<p>Many cooking shows leave out our favorite part of cooking: what it means to cook for people. That's the real power of cooking, especially home cooking. Its ability to bring people together. On both ends, when I cook for someone or when I eat food someone has prepare for me, I feel more connected with that person.</p>
						
					<p>The design challenge is to create cooking material that is warm, has depth and is non-intimidating. My aim is for Home Spice to tell more human-centric stories around cooking.</p>
